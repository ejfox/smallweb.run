# smallweb.run

This repository is a monorepo of all my apps running under the smallweb.run domain.

I edit these files locally, and use [mutagen](https://mutagen.io) to sync them to the server.

If you have your own instance of smallweb, you can copy any folder from this repository to your own server, and it should work out of the box. Some apps require a `.env` file to be created in the root of the app folder, with the required environment variables.
