Hey there! I'm happy to announce the release of Smallweb `0.15`.

I must admit I spent quite a bit of time on this one, and I ended up scrapping a lot of the work I did.

I spent a lot of time trying to add a tunneling solution to smallweb based on wireguard, before realizing that it was not the right approach. Instead, I plan to focus

## TLDR

- you should move your smallweb config to `$SMALLWEB_DIR/.smallweb/config.json`
- the global env variables are now set in `$SMALLWEB_DIR/.env`, and not in the smallweb config
- you now need to add a `--cron` flag to the `smallweb up` command to run the crons

## New Architecture

I talked about my previous smallweb setup in [a previous post](./2024-10-02_my_smallweb_setup.md). In this setup, smallweb is deployed on a VPS, and I sync the app to my local machine using [mutagen](https://mutagen.io/).

Even though this setup worked quite well, I found it to be a bit cumbersome. The main issue I had was that I had to connect to the VPS each time I wanted to run an app cli using `smallweb run`, or generate a new token using `smallweb token`.

But why was it the case? Well, the `smallweb` cli needed to access the smallweb config (stored at `~/.config/smallweb/config.json`) and the internal db (stored at `~/.local/share/smallweb/db.sqlite`), which were only available on the VPS.

If I somehow managed to bundle all the necessary files in the smallweb directory, the state of smallweb would be seamlessly replicated on my local machine, and I would be able to:

- use every `smallweb` commands on both my local machine and the VPS
- be able to run the cli entrypoints of my apps on my local machine

So i just did that. You should now put your config in `$SMALLWEB_DIR/.smallweb/config.json`, and the tokens and sessions will be generated in `$SMALLWEB_DIR/.smallweb/data`.

The beauty of this architecture is that you are not limited to a single server anymore. You can replicate your smallweb dir to any machine you want, and run the smallweb cli from there.

Just make sure that the smallweb and deno versions are the same on all machines (I'm working on a way to automate this).

## Easier admin apps

Building admin apps (apps that can access the files of other apps) was always a bit of a pain. You had to:

- publish the REST api as a smallweb app
- generate a token for the api
- pass both the token and the api url as: `SMALLWEB_API_TOKEN` and `SMALLWEB_API_URL` env variables

This is no longer the case! Now you can just add the `admin` field to the app config:

```json
{
    "admin": true
}
```

And use the smallweb sdk to fetch the api:

```ts
import { fetchApi } from "@smallweb/sdk";

const apps = await fetchApi("/v0/apps").then((res) => res.json());
```

If you still want to publish the api (for usage outside of smallweb), you can still easily do it by creating a new smallweb app:

```ts
import { api } from "@smallweb/sdk";

export default api()
```

```json
{
    "admin": true,
    "private": true,
    "publicRoutes": [
        "openapi.json"
    ]
}
```

This means that the `smallweb:api` entrypoint can no longer be used.

## Global .env

Instead of configuring the global environments variable from the smallweb config, you should now use a `.env` file at the root of the smallweb dir.

```sh
# ~/smallweb/.env
MY_SECRET=123
```

## `open` function for cli entrypoints

Cli entrypoints used to share the same restrictions as the rest of the app. However, having the ability to open a url in the user's browser is quite necessary for cli entrypoints.

You can now easily achieve it by using the `open` function:

```ts
import { open } from "@smallweb/sdk";

export default {
    async run() {
        await open("https://smallweb.run");
    }
}
```

## Update to crons

Since smallweb can now run from multiple servers, you now need to specify which server should trigger the crons.

You can do this by adding the `--cron` flag to the `smallweb up` command:

```sh
# run both the http server and the crons
smallweb up --cron
```

Or, if you want to dedicate a server to crons, you can use the `smallweb cron up` command:

```sh
# run only the crons
smallweb cron up
```

## Ability to pin an auth provider

Smallweb use lastlogin to protect private apps behind authentication.

Previously, autheticating required two steps: first you had to select an auth provider, then go through the auth flow.

From now on you can specify which auth provider you intend to use from the smallweb config:

```json
{
    "auth": "google"
}
```

## Log Handling

Logs cannot really be shared between servers, so the `smallweb logs` command needed to change.

Logs are now avaible at `https://<app>.<domain>/_logs/[http|console]`, and the `smallweb logs [app]` command will just open the logs in the browser.

## What's next?
