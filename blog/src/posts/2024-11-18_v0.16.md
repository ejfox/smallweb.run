Hello again!

With the release of Smallweb `0.15` last week, you might have expected a bit of a break. But I've been working on some really transforming performance improvements these last few days, and I decided to release them as soon as possible.

So here we are, with Smallweb `0.16`!

<!-- more -->

You can upgrade to the latest version by running the `smallweb upgrade` command (or `smallweb upgrade 0.16.0` if you want to be specific).

## TLDR

- smallweb can now reuse the same deno process for multiple requests
- symlinks can now be used as apps
- you can now create apps from templates using the `smallweb create --template` flag
- smallweb now supports serving a `index.md` file as your website root
- plugins are now stored in `$SMALLWEB_DIR/.smallweb/plugins`, and can have any file extension
- `smallweb sync` command to manage the mutagen sync
- admin apps now have access to the `smallweb cli`
- smallweb now has a bluesky account: [@smallweb.run](https://bsky.app/profile/smallweb.run)

## New Runtime inspired by Val Town

You might have noticed that smallweb apps can feel really slow, especially for web apps with a lot of assets. This is because smallweb used to spawn a new deno process for each request, which added a lot of overhead. This was a design choice I made to avoid the need for a dev server or a build step. But hosting in apps in smallweb should not include such a big performance hit. So I decided to rework the smallweb runtime to reuse the same deno process for multiple requests.

To restart the app only when necessary, I added a `watcher` process in the smallweb evaluation server that listens to changes in the app dir.  When a change is detected, the current worker replaced by a new process. Apps automatically stops after 10 seconds of inactivity to free up resources. In order to be able to distinguish between user updates (that should trigger a restart) and app updates (that should not), I added a `data` folder in the app dir in the last version. Apps now only have write access to this folder, and read access to the whole app dir.

In my testing, these changes have been so transformative that I don't even feel the need to bother including performance benchmark in this blog post. Just update smallweb, and you'll feel the difference instantly! Thanks to [max](https://x.com/mxmcd) for inspiring this change. Without his work on the new [Val Town](https://val.town) runtime, it would have taken me a lot more time to figure out how to implement it.

## Supports for symlinks

Symlinks are now correctly resolved in the smallweb dir. It means that you can create an alias for your app, and it will be available at an additional domain.

```sh
# create a gh symlink to the github app
ln -s ./github gh
```

Now both `github.smallweb.run` and `gh.smallweb.run` will point to the same app.

## Add support for index.md

If your static app contains an `index.md` file (but no `index.html`), it will be automatically compiled to html and served at the root of the app. This is useful for mini apps that only contain a single markdown file.

## `--template` flag for `smallweb create`

You can now specify a template when creating a new app:

```sh
#
smallweb create --template=github.com/pomdtr/smallweb.run/www smallweb-homepage
```

You can get the list of available providers in [go-getter readme](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-protocols-and-detectors).

If you create a template repository on github, make sure to add a `smallweb-template` tag to it!

## Reworked Plugin API

Smallweb used to have the same plugin system as git: you just needed to add `smallweb-` prefixed binary somewhere in your path, and it would be picked up by smallweb.

I had two issues with this approach:

- plugins were not synced with the smallweb dir
- since they could not have file extensions, syntax highlighting was tricky in some editors.

From now on, plugins will be stored at `$SMALLWEB_DIR/.smallweb/plugins`, now longer need to include the `smallweb-` prefix, and can have any file extension.

```console
$ tree ~/smallweb/.smallweb
~/smallweb/.smallweb
├── config.json
└── plugins
    ├── pull.sh
    └── push.sh
```

If you want your plugins to be only available for a specific host, you can put it in `$XDG_DATA_DIR/smallweb/plugins` instead.

## `smallweb sync` command

Smallweb shines when you have live syncing between your local machine and your server using [mutagen](https://mutagen.io). But the recommended command to achieve it was a bit intimidating:

```sh
mutagen sync create --name=smallweb-run --ignore=node_modules,.DS_Store --ignore-vcs --mode=two-way-resolved \
  smallweb.run:/home/smallweb.run/smallweb ~/smallweb
```

Instead, if you have smallweb installed in both the local and remote machine, you can now run:

```sh
# smallweb sync create [ssh-remote]
smallweb sync create smallweb.run
```

Smallweb will automatically infer the smallweb dir from the remote machine, and create the mutagen sync for you.

There are also a bunch of other commands allowing to monitor or terminate the sync. You can even register the sync process as a service using `smallweb sync service register`.

Behind the scenes, every `smallweb sync` command maps to a single `mutagen` command.

## Admin apps now have access to the cli

Admin apps now have access to the `smallweb cli` (but plugins are disabled).

```ts
// ~/smallweb/changelog/main.ts
export default {
  fetch: () => {
    const { SMALLWEB_EXEC_PATH, SMALLWEB_ADMIN } = Deno.env.toObject();

    if (!SMALLWEB_ADMIN) {
        throw new Error("This app is not an admin app");
    }

    const command = new Deno.Command(SMALLWEB_EXEC_PATH, ["changelog"]);
    const output = await command.output();
    const body = new TextDecoder().decode(output.success ? output.stdout : output.stderr);

    return new Response(body, {
        status: output.success ? 200 : 500,
        headers: {
            "content-type": "text/plain",
        },
    });
  }
}
```

You can use this mechanism to the smallweb cli from the browser:

Make sure to setup proper authentication first!

## New bluesky account for smallweb

I've been in an honeymoon phase with [bluesky](https://bsky.social) for the past few days, and I decided to move the smallweb account there. Bluesky is far more open to automatisation than twitter, and I think it's a better fit for smallweb.

If you have a bluesky account, please follow [@smallweb.run](https://bsky.app/profile/smallweb.run). And if you feel like it, you can also follow me at [@pomdtr.me](https://bsky.app/profile/pomdtr.me).

## What's next?

### VS Code integration

I'm writing this blog post from VS Code, running in smallweb!

![vscode demo](./img/vscode_demo.png)

It's still need some polishing before I make it public, but it is promising.

With the new runtime, it already runs like a charm!

### Smallweb Cloud

I now have a clear plan on how to build smallweb cloud, and it might come sooner than you think.

If you're interested in the idea of a managed smallweb instance, please signup at <https://cloud.smallweb.run>.
