> ⚠️ This is an experimental feature, and the API might change in the future. It's targeted at advanced users who want to store secrets in their git repositories.

Two days ago, [Taras](https://github.com/tarasglek) shared the [age-armored-decrypt](https://jsr.io/@tarasglek/age-armored-decrypt) on the [smallweb discord](https://discord.smallweb.run), which he used to store secrets directly in his git repositories.

I was immediately intrigued by it. My own [smallweb.run repo](https://github.com/pomdtr/smallweb.run) needs a bunch of secrets to be injected in the environment to work, but none of them are actually stored on github. Instead, I used to ignore them using the following `.gitingore`:

```gitignore
node_modules

# ignore all secrets
.env
```

This meant that my secrets where only stored on my laptop, and I feared about some scenarios where I would lose them.

Taras told me that he created this library because [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) was incompatible with [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy). I had a look at the sops documentation, and it seemed like a perfect fit for my use case.

And after a few hours playing with it, I was decided to integrate it in smallweb.

## How does it work?

Let's adapt the smallweb.run repository to use sops.

First I'll need to generate a private / public [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) key pair:

```sh
brew install age sops
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/sops/age

# generate a new key pair
age-keygen -o ~/Library/Application\ Support/sops/age
```

A public key will be printed to stdout, that we will put in `~/$SMALLWEB_DIR/.sops.yaml`:

```yaml
creation_rules:
  - key_groups:
      - age:
          - age184aa2h77n8hjhwthjv0ddz3leu49jtuhlafspwm29sej84zayd6qcrrwe6 # macbook
```

To create a new secrets, I can now run:

```sh
cd ~/smallweb/my-app

# create a new secrets.env file
sops edit secrets.env
```

An editor will open, and I can write my secrets in it:

```env
MY_SECRET=super_secret
```

After saving and closing the editor, the secrets will be encrypted and saved in `secrets.env`.

To update the secrets, I can run the same command again:

```sh
# edit the secrets.env file
sops edit secrets.env
```

Since the secrets are encrypted, I can now safely commit them to the repository!

When smallweb starts your app, it will automatically decrypt the secrets using the private key stored at `~/Library/Application\ Support/sops/age` and inject them in the environment (using the [sops library](https://github.com/getsops/sops/blob/main/decrypt/decrypt.go)).

To allow my vps server (running on debian) to decrypt the secrets, I'll need to perform the same steps as on my macbook:

```sh
sudo apt install -y age
mkdir -p ~/.config/sops/age
age-keygen -o ~/.config/sops/age
```

And put the public key in `~/$SMALLWEB_DIR/.sops.yaml`:

```yaml
creation_rules:
  - key_groups:
      - age:
          - age184aa2h77n8hjhwthjv0ddz3leu49jtuhlafspwm29sej84zayd6qcrrwe6 # macbook
          - age1lzt3p2vwf7vtv9lpyt63t8kdtgwjm8td2yzj88xwygr3c5rvxdsqwr3rge # vps
```

Since I added a new recipient, I'll need to re-encrypt the secrets:

```sh
sops updatekeys secrets.env
```

And now both my macbook and my vps can decrypt the secrets!

If you prefer storing your secrets in a json file, you can replace `secrets.env` by `secrets.json` in the previous commands.
