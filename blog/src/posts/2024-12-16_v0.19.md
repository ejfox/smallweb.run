## An easier way to install smallweb on a fresh VPS

Smallweb got way easier to install! You can just buy any VPS (with a public ipv4 address), and run the following command:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://scripts.smallweb.run/vps.sh | bash
```

And you're done! You'll be able to access your workspace using a `sslip.io` domain, without having to deal with setting up a single DNS record.

Of course, you might still intend to use your own domain, in which case you can run:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://scripts.smallweb.run/vps.sh | bash -s <domain>
```

## smallweb up --on-demand-tls

In order to make it possible, I added a new flag to the `smallweb up` command: `--on-demand-tls`. This flag will instruct smallweb to manage the creation of TLS certificates for you, and ensure that your workspace is accessible over HTTPS.

This is useful if you don't want to deal with the hassle of setting up a reverse proxy, and you don't mind the extra latency that comes with on-demand TLS.

## smallweb init

If you just installed smallweb, and want a quick way to get started, you can now run:

```sh
smallweb init <domain>
```

And your smallweb dir will be initialized with a few example apps.

## remove default domain

Previously, smallweb would default to the `localhost` domain if no domain was provided. I realized that it was a bad idea, as it was only useful for local development. I removed this default, and now you have to provide a domain name in the `$SMALLWEB_DIR/.smallweb/config.json` file.

If you did not have a one setup already and were relying on the default, you can add the following to your config file:

```json
// ~/smallweb/.smallweb/config.json
{
  "domain": "localhost"
}
```

## move addr, cert and key from global to flags

I moved the `addr`, `cert` and `key` configuration from the global config to the `smallweb up` command. Since the config files is often synced between different machines, it was a bad idea to have the certificates and keys in there.

Instead, you can now provide them as flags to the `smallweb up` command:

```sh
smallweb up --addr 0.0.0.0:443 --cert /path/to/cert.pem --key /path/to/key.pem
```

You can also provide them to the `smallweb service install` command:

```sh
smallweb service install -- --addr 0.0.0.0:443 --cert /path/to/cert.pem --key /path/to/key.pem
```

## --dir global flag

In addition to the `$SMALLWEB_DIR` env variable, there is now a `--dir` flag that you can use to specify the directory where the smallweb workspace is located. This flag has priority over the env variable.

It is especially useful for creating aliases when you have multiple workspaces on a single machine.

```sh
alias smallweb.run="smallweb --dir ~/smallweb/smallweb.run"
alias pomdtr.me="smallweb --dir ~/smallweb/pomdtr.me"

 # list the apps in the smallweb.run workspace
smallweb.run ls

# open https://blog.pomdtr.me
pomdtr.me open blog
```

## smallweb install

All smallweb apps can register a `run` handler, accessible throught the `smallweb run` command. For example, the [smallblog](https://jsr.io/@tayzendev/smallblog) app bundles a cli:

```sh
smallweb run smallblog
```

From now on, you'll be able to install these clis in your $PATH by running:

```sh
# creates ~/.local/bin/smallblog.<your-domain>
smallweb install smallblog
```

Meaning that i'm now able to run:

```sh
smallblog.smallweb.run ls
```

And it will the blog posts of <https://smallblog.smallweb.run>.

## Add support for clean urls

Clean urls are urls that don't have the `.html` extension. They are quite common in static site generators, so I added support for them in the default smallweb file server.

## Pass head elements through yaml frontmatter

The smallweb file server automatically render markdown to html. I added the ability to pass head elements through the yaml frontmatter. This is useful for setting the title or favicon of a page, and even inject custom css or js.

```md
---
title: My awesome page
favicon: https://icons.smallweb.run/smallweb.svg
---

# Hello world
```
